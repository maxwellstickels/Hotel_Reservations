## Summary
Hotel Coding is an imaginary, definitely-not-real hotel, and hotel-coding.herokuapp.com is its website! This website serves as a template for hotels to use, and it allows users to make reservations and leave feedback on their reservations. In addition, manager accounts can also be installed directly by those with access to the server; these accounts have control to view/modify users, rooms, reservations, and user feedback. Profanity in user feedback is also filtered using the bad-words code library.

## Technology Used

This website was designed with HTML 5 + Handlebars, CSS 3.0, Javascript (2020 Build) in Visual Studio Code 1.57.1. The project makes use of several npm libraries: bcrypt, connect-session-sequelize, dotenv, express, express-handlebars, express-session, , as well as our new technology bad-words (a profanity filter used for user feedback). The live website is deployed to Heroku's servers.
